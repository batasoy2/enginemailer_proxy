Super-sketchy EngineMailer plugin for Wordpress.

This is very RAW - It intercepts Wordpress mail function and lets you use 
EngineMailer instead. This only sends mails. Someone may fork it with
adding some functionality, make it look nicer, or bring peace to our planet.

I was surprised to see EngineMailer does not have a plugin for WP - So, invested
30 minutes for putting this together in the middle of a huge project, so ...
No guarantess or batteries included.
